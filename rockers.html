            <b>About the band</b><br>
          
        The rockers band was formed in the 5th of july 1996 and consisted
        of only two members, rockland steve and james ershire,
        and hence the named rockers from the joining of the first
        letters of their names, <strong>rock</strong>land and
        <strong>ers</strong>hire. later in 2002 two more members joined 
        in forming the present Rockers band but still retaining the original
        name.
